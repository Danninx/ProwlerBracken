# Prowler Bracken
Gives the bracken the prowler sound effects from Into the Spiderverse

## To Do:
- Rework skinwalker mod source to add "wild" prowler sounds
- Find a way to disable the fear distortion effect, which is affecting the chase music
- Figure out which audio is the rattling noise when you "spot" the bracken, and replace it with ProwlerAmbient1/2
