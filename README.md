# Prowler Bracken
Gives the bracken the prowler sound effects from Into the Spiderverse

## To Do:
- Test "wild" prowler sounds
- Find out what is distorting chase music
- Figure out which audio is the rattling noise when you "spot" the bracken, and replace it with ProwlerAmbient1/2
- Get Prowler model for bracken replacement
- Prowler noise plays for each player on spawn
